# Local-Hack-Day: Build (2022)

LHD:Build is an opportunity given by MLH to programmers/developers all over the world to create amazing projects and finishes challenges within a day. The hackathon runs weeklong 
giving participants new challenges everyday. From making a discord bot to creating an adventure text game on python, the challenges have a wide range of variety.

In this repository, I have added some of the challenges and projects I made for the hackathon.
